      <h1>What is Boilersuit</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Boilersuit Light</b> is a front-end application to <b>extract, prepare, transform and analysestructured data.</b> There is no need to set up a database connection to start working - Boilersuit automatically creates a local <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>        database file. This works astonishingly well with data up to a couple of gigabytes (in theory almost <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q8">unlimited</a>).

      <h2>Boilerspeech and SQL short-hand notation</h2>
      <p>
        Transformation logic is defined in a special script language which is a superset of SQL. That means you can use native SQL if you like:
        <pre>
CREATE TABLE germanclients AS SELECT id, name, location FROM clients WHERE location='Germany' ORDER BY name ASC;
        </pre>
        The shorthand BS like notation would be
        <pre>
germanclients := clients(id, name{ASC}, location{='Germany'});
        </pre>
      More handy <b>short notations</b> can be found <a href="#HandySQL">here.</a> Apart from the handy short notations for frequently used SQL queries
      </p>
      <h2>Pre-Processing Functions</h2>
      <p>
      As an additional feature, BS provides <b>pre-processing functions</b> for attributes, e.g. to 'suck' out parts of an attribute based on regular expressions,
      or to conveniently format numbers and dates, and others like so:
      <pre>
germanclients2 := germanclients(id, SUCK(name, [A-Za-z]+, 1) AS firstname, SUCK(name, [A-Za-z]+, 1) AS lastname);
      </pre>

        <h3>SELECT</h3>
        <p>
          Transformation logic is defined in a special script language which is a superset of SQL. That means you can use native SQL if you like:
          <pre>
CREATE TABLE germanclients AS SELECT id, name, location FROM clients WHERE location='Germany' ORDER BY name ASC;
          </pre>
          The shorthand BS like notation would be
          <pre>
germanclients := clients(id, name{ASC}, location{='Germany'});
          </pre>
        </p>
        <h3>COUNT</h3>
        <p>
          <pre>#table;
#mytable(attr1 like 'some value');
#cars(serialnumber = 12345);
          </pre>
        </p>
        <h3>LEFT OUTER JOIN</h3>
        <pre>
-- SELECT * FROM ourcompanies oc LEFT OUTER JOIN companylist cl ON oc.name = cl.name
exactmatch := ourcompanies(name)->companylist(name);
        </pre>
        <h3>FREQUENCY TABLES</h3>
        <p>
          Often we have a code, or an id, in two tables and we would like to count how often
          they occur in any of both tables (if at all), and also see which keys exist only in the one but
          not in the other, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <pre>
exactmatch := ourcompanies(name)->companylist(name);
        </pre>
        <h3>CREATE / DROP TABLES</h3>
        <p>
          Creating/Dropping a table in Boilersuit is as simple as typing
          <pre>
+mytable(*id, attribute1, attribute2); -- create
-mytable; -- drop
          </pre>
        </p>
        <h2>Preprocessing Functions</h2>
        <a name="bsf"></a>
        A range of preprocessing functions are available:
        <table>
 <tr><th>Function</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
 <tr>
 <td>bsfMagicDate</td>
 <td>Tries to recognize a date expression from various formats into the BS default format MM.dd.yyyy.
 Works even if the formats in the source data vary from row
 to row. For unrecognized expressions, a warning will be shown.
 <pre>
 -- checking against common formats
 transformed := source(, magicDate(MYDATE) AS STANDARDIZED_MY_DATE);
              </pre>
 If a preferred set of allowed formats should be used, they can be added as arguments:
 <pre>
 -- checking against y-m-d and y.m.d:
 transformed := source(, magicDate(MYDATE, y-m-d, y.m.d[,...]) AS STANDARDIZED_MY_DATE);
              </pre>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>bsfFormatNumber</td>
 <td>Constructs a string using a pre-existing number in a certain way often useful to construct artificial IDs
 for things. Lets assume we have a table with id's
 <pre>id
 -----
 1
 239
 4000
 </pre>
 Then, we may want to construct id's of uniform length like so:
 <pre>
 result := table(id, formatNumber(id, A-DDDD) AS NEW_ID);

 -- Result will be as follows:
 id       NEW_ID
 ----     -----------
 1        A-0001
 239      A-0239
 4000     A-4000
 </pre>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>bsfSuck</td>
 <td>"Sucks" out specific patterns from the source data based on a regular expression</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>bsfHash</td>
 <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">Hashes</a> the source data using the String.hashCode method (probably depends on JVM used to run BS).
 If the hash value is > 0, an 'X' is added to the hash as a prefix, otherwise and 'Y' - this explains the Xxxxxx resp. Yxxxxx format of the hash result.

    <h1>How to get it</h1>
    Boilersuit comes in 3 pieces:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Component</th>
        <th>What is it</th>
        <th>Get it</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>boilersuit-core</td>
        <td>
          This is the engine behind BS containing what you need to connect to databases, interpretation logic needed to run scripts etc. It is a pre-requisite of any Boilersuit application and it's a java library.
